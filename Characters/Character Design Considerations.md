The Kieran Empire is the last of the Masaquani kingdoms. While somewhat xenophobic, it is welcoming to humans, Kraken, and Scurillians and hostile to Ugak.  The other races scrape by in the city on the edges of society.  

Here’s a  racial breakdown of the city of Kiera, the last great city of the Masaquani kingdoms, balancing political dominance, social structures, and marginalized groups within an urban power center:
### **Racial Demographics of Kiera**

| **Race**                | **Percentage** | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Masaquani]]           | 45%            | Dominant political and cultural class. Kiera is their last great stronghold, and the nobility, bureaucracy, and elite merchants are mostly Masaquani.            |
| [[Humans]]              | 20%            | Well-integrated into society, especially in the middle classes. Often serve as soldiers, merchants, civil servants, or minor nobles.                             |
| [[Kraken]]              | 10%            | Valued for magical and scholarly contributions. Many serve as mages, alchemists, or advisors in the Circle of Knowledge. Sometimes viewed with awe or suspicion. |
| [[Scurillians]]         | 7%             | Accepted, especially in artisan and trade sectors. Some work in espionage or alchemy; others operate as independent cartographers or fixers.                     |
| [[Doreen]]              | 5%             | Marginalized. Distrusted due to cultural differences and past piracy ties. Most live in dockside slums or work as mercenaries.                                   |
| [[Atani]]               | 4%             | Rare in cities; most are wanderers or performers. Viewed as exotic or spiritual, often tolerated for novelty or entertainment.                                   |
| [[Half-Ugak (Red Men)]] | 3%             | Deeply mistrusted, though sometimes tolerated if they reject their Ugak heritage. Common targets of discrimination and scapegoating.                             |
| [[Grael]]               | 3%             | Feared due to strength and primal reputation. Often relegated to heavy labor or criminal work; some serve as bodyguards or pit fighters.                         |
| [[Kehana]]              | 2%             | Nearly universally disliked and distrusted. Known for predatory behavior. Often live in the city’s most neglected areas, under heavy scrutiny.                   |
| [[Ugak]]                | <1%            | Actively persecuted. Considered enemies of civilization. Any Ugak in Kiera is either a prisoner, gladiator, or under constant threat of violence.                |
