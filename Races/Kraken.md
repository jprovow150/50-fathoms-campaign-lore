# Kraken
Kraken are tall, slender, red to purple-skinned humanoids with squid-like features. Though they are ill-liked by most for their aloof and mysterious ways, many are naturally gifted elementalists. Such individuals are highly sought after by ship’s captains, but rarely welcomed by their crews.

The kraken once lived in a single great city, half-submerged and half-afloat, called Tar Tarris. They had the greatest fleet in the world, comprised of a dozen Great Ships and thousands of smaller attack vessels. This great fleet sailed against the Sea Hags soon after the witches rose but was destroyed. Worse, the witches retaliated by leveling Tar Tarris, killing thousands more innocent kraken in their rage.

Now a single Great Ship remains. High Admiral Caspian of the kraken gathered all those who survived. He kept a small number of his greatest warrior-mages aboard the Great Ship and told the rest to wander the world until they found a way to defeat the witches.

The kraken Admiral still wanders the Thousand Isles on some great and mysterious quest unknown to all others.

The rest of his people continue the mission, or have given up and go about their own personal quests.

These wanderers are much like the doreen, whom they admire. Both are the last of their race, and will probably never see their people truly thrive again.

Though most kraken are mages, some are fierce warriors as well. Those who once served in the kraken navy wield feather-light scimitars engraved with exotic images of the sea. Kraken bone swords are enchanted, but only for the kraken themselves.
### Names
Kraken’s true names are unpronounceable burbles and glurps. Wary of becoming mocked like the kehana, they name themselves. These vary, but tend to be single long words such as Keraptis, Jaraquay, Telimos, and Faniferous.
