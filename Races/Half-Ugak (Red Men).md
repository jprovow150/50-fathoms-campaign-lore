# Half Ugak (Red Men)
The Red Men of Torath-Ka are savage barbarians who look something like red-tinged neanderthals. They are massive brutes with dirty brown hair and brown eyes and limited intellects.

Most are too brutal to put aboard ships with good-hearted crews, but they are sometimes captured and pushed toward their captor’s foes as “shock troops.”

Occasionally, Red Men escape and mate with humans or masaquani. The children of these (typically unwilling) pairings are called a variety of things, none of them polite. Half-ugak or— incorrectly—Red Men are the least offensive.

Half-ugaks usually have terrible childhoods. Most who survive are raised in secret by their parents or sold into slavery from an early age. Such rearing does little to improve their natural hostility.

Pirates and privateers alike find half-ugaks fantastic crewmen. They are simple enough to obey orders yet barbaric enough to terrify many foes before a shot is fired or an axe is swung.
### Ugak Raids

A few years before the flood, ugak raids against southwestern Ograpog dramatically increased. A large number of half-ugaks resulted from this period. King Amemnus chased the Ugak back to their jungle highlands (now Torath-Ka), but a number of newborn half-breeds were left in the path of this brutal campaign.
### Names
Half-ugaks have single, short names such as Ug, Lak, or Tonga if they were raised by Ugak. It is considered rude to give a halfugak a masaquani family name, but a few brave souls have done so regardless.
