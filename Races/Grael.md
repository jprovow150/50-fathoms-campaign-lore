# Grael
Grael are gray-skinned humanoids with immense layers of fat, beady black eyes, and short, dull tusks. Their obese appearance belies their muscles, which grow quite large beneath the burden of their naturally blubbery skin. Visitors sometimes call them sea-lions, a name the grael take pride in once they learn just what a “lion” is.

Grael live in prides composed of their immediate families. Most dwell in crude stone huts on the far northern island of Arfk, but many are recruited by pirates and the like for their brawn and so set sail for promises of booty and violence.
### Names
The grael are unique in that they name themselves. When a baby grael first emerges from its mother, it clears its throat of embryonic fluid with a loud grunt. That grunt becomes its name, giving the grael such names as Rark, Flunk, Hok, and so on. It doesn’t seem to matter much to the grael that many of their people share similar names.
