# Human
Some natives see them as an infestation. Others as saviors.

The truth is that humans are like any other race. Some are as pure as the snows of Arfk while others are as black as the Coaker Mountains.

Humans are called “visitors” or “earthers” by the other races, though it is something of a misnomer for few believe they will ever find a way home. “Newcomers” might be a more appropriate term since they’ve now been here for 13 years.

Though they come from many places and many times, all humans have one thing in common—they were brought into Caribdus by the Maiden. At some point in their life they boarded a ship. A thick mist rolled in and the captain and crew heard what sounded like a woman crying. They pushed through the fog, expecting to find a lone survivor of some tragic shipwreck. Instead, they saw only the ghostly outline of a young girl. She hovered above the sea, weeping loudly—but as if through a distant doorway.

The sailors pressed on, whether toward her or away from her, and found themselves in unfamiliar waters. A storm approached as if from nowhere, suddenly surrounding the vessel and threatening to tear it to splinters. The ship sailed on, slowly sailing into a morass of green debris, jutting timbers, and the bloated corpses of things that weren’t quite human.

At this point tales often diverge. Some ships never made it out of the Flotsam Sea, but survivors were picked up by scavengers long after. Other vessels pressed through the green morass and were attacked by long-dead sailors crawling up the bow from the depths, or alien octopons.

The humans of Caribdus can come from any country on Earth, from any time between 1400 and 1815. Any person who ever set foot on a ship can be drawn into the mists by the Maiden.

Only children of 13 years or younger can be natives. Humans and masaquani can produce offspring as well. The child physically resembles his parents’ features as with any babe, but mechanically he must choose to be either a human or a masaquani.

Humans and other races, even the atani, do not produce offspring, though matings are commonplace.

Language is a major barrier to those who first arrive in Caribdus. Fortunately, the tongue spoken by the rest of the world is masaquani, and it is quite easy for humans to learn.
