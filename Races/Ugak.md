# Ugak
The Ugak are a race of primitive brutes found primarily in the Savage Land of Torath-Ka. There are exceptional individuals, of course, but as a rule, Ugak are violent cannibals concerned with little more than the simplest booty (food, drink, a few shiny baubles).

A few tribes have been known to harness the giant lizards known as yellowbacks for use in battle.  Ugak prowl the islands far from the more civilized places, and frequently serve on pirate ships as well.

Ugak villages often have vast stores of diamonds and other precious metals they use for everyday tools. If a village is captured, roll a King’s Ransom for the reavers.
### Ugak Chief
Ugak villages are often ruled by shamans, but hunting and war parties are led by the strongest brute in the group, the Chief.
### Ugak Shaman
The “wisest” of the  Ugak communicate directly with distant powers that grant them dark magic.
### Names
Ugak have single, short names such as Ug, Lak, or Tonga.
