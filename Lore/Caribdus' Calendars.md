# Caribdus' Post Flood Calendar
The Caribdus calendar is similar to Earth’s Gregorian calendar in structure but uses a unique epoch starting from the year of the flood (00 AF, After the Flood). This standardization was adopted after the arrival of humans from Earth, whose own calendar heavily influenced the system. The months and days retain their Earth names for simplicity, making it easier for humans and natives alike to adapt. The Emperor of Kiera was instrumental in the calendar’s adoption, declaring it the official system on 09/01/02 AF. It was seen as a practical and symbolic decision, uniting the survivors of the flood under a shared understanding of time and marking a new era in Caribdus’ history.
