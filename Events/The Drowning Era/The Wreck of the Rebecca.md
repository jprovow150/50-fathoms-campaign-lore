## Summary
The Rebecca was a medium-sized frigate hauling lumber from the Free Towns to the Kieran Empire. While off of the coast of Torath-Ka, the ship was hit by something large below the waterline. Several of the crew were sucked out the bottom in an instant, and a broken lantern set the hull ablaze.

Captain, Jonas Abraham from Earthâ€™s England, managed to beach the ship on the shores of Torath-Ka, the Savage Land, but the Rebecca was doomed. These events started the Heroes of the Hagfall on their quest to slay the hags and free Caribdus from their dark magic, and the flood.
