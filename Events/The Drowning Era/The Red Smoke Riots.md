## Summary
The Red Smoke Riots began as a workers’ protest in the lower terraces of Kiera and quickly escalated into a violent uprising that exposed deep fractures between the city's arcane elite, noble ruling class, and impoverished citizens.

The riots were named after the plumes of acrid red smoke that choked the streets—produced when looters ignited stolen arcane components from Circle of Knowledge supply stores and chemical forges.
