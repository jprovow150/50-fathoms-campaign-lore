## Summary
Torquemada captured Tressa the Red from her home in The Teeth and transported her to Isla Dios. The Spanish Inquisition questioned and tortured her for 17 days before crucifying her atop the fortress of Isla Dios. Her final act while being crucified was to reach out to the heroes through her familiar, Carifax, to let them know what had happened.  She converted her heart into a magical artifact that when crushed, would give the user 17 minutes of unlimited magical power.
